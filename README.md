# Rules

This repository is an Artificial Intelligence work based on decision rules. In this work, it is basically
implement the rule-by-coverage learning algorithm, implement a rule pruning algorithm to reduce error, and
apply the implemented learning algorithms to the analysis of various data sets. In particular for: 1ยบ-Guess the
political party (republican or democrat) of a US congressman from what was voted over a year. 2nd-Model the criterion
from a bank to grant a loan.
The implementation of both algorithms is done in Python 3.0, in this work several data sets are handled,
which are used to apply algorithms such as play_tennis.py or lenses.py.
